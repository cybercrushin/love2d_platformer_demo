-- This file will be loaded through love.filesystem.load
-- This file describes the different states and frames of the animation

	Each sprite sheet contains one or multiple states
	Each states is represented as a line in the image file
	The following object describes the different states
	Switching between different states can be done through code

	members ->
		imageSrc : path to the image (png, tga, bmp or jpg)
		defaultState : the first state
		states : a table containing each state

	(State)
	Each state contains the following members ->
		frameCount : the number of frames in the state
		offsetX : starting from the left, the position (in px) of the first frame of the state (aka on the line)
		offsetY : starting from the top, the position of the line (px)
		framwW : the width of each frame in the state
		frameH : the height of each frame in the state
		nextState : the state which will follow after the last frame is reached
		switchDelay : the time between each frame (seconds as floating point)
